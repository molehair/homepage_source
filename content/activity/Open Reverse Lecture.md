An open lecture was held by [HIT lab](http://hit.skku.edu/) regarding basic reversing skills for undergraduate students. Students who were interesting in reversing participated in the lecture.

Four classes for two days(2015. 4.7 / 4.9), I lectured the last one. I recomposed [this exploit](http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/7702/) which includes stack overflow, how to build a PoC, and what payload could be.
