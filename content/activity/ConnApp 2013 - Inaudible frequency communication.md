[ConnApp](http://appcontest.skku.edu/) is a mobile app competition, one of subprojects of [Seoul Accord](http://www.seoulaccord.com/). Our team(Kiyeol Lim, Jiman Hwang, Dongeui Kim) made two simple apps(a provider and a beneficiary) that communicates each other over inaudible frequency.

In a market, each section has one or more providing speaker, making an inaudible sound. On the other hand, a shopper's smartphone operating the beneficiary app receives and analyzes the sound, and shows a web page provided by seller.

Since the bandwidth is terribly small, a couple of characters is transmitted at once, which introduced an additional server that maps transmitted code to url link.

Result was an excellence award. Thanks.
