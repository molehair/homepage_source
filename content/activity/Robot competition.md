Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/IW6Qbyxe6Q0) for information about Robot competition, powered by [RISE lab](http://ris.skku.edu/).

It was during the class named **Design Laboratory on Vibration and Dynamic Systems** on the Spring, 2014.

Here is our team's product.

Given some elements; three motors, two laser sensors, one sonar sensor, and peripheral parts, it was hard for us to defeat each stage in 3 minutes, especially the challenges including collecting blocks, and climbing up a slope. It was definite that two motors are for driving, remaining just one. How could we kill two birds with one stone?

We made the two motors take over the collecting mission.

This is the view from the bottom. the fan whose three trailing ends are colored by red is attached to the one of driving motors. As the robot moves forward, the fan rotates and take a block into the robot. Originally there were two fans, but one is removed after looking jammed blocks at the enterance several times.

We used the last motor for climbing up. In order to avoid slippery roller, we were supposed to let the robot covere the slope with a plate, and run over it.

The sad thing was that the collecting block in the aforementioned way required wide enterance at the bottom of robot and large space inside the robot, which made herself bigger eventually, which needed the larger plate. It was bulky and heavy, ending with failure of mission. This fact also throw away our efforts about the last mission, navigating with light sensors. Because there was no chance of the next mission before completing the current one.

Meanwhile, the first stage is driving robot without manual control. I looked up a disseration in which navigating with only one sonar sensor, only to find that it took too much time. Hence, pre-installed routing was proper, which I did, and it worked.

To sum up, the score was low, but it was one of interesting project I’ve gone through.
