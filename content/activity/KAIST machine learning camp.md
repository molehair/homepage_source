There was online learning camp at [elice.io](http://elice.io) regarding Machine Learning(ML). I knew the content was hot those days(and still is), and enrolled the class.

The programming assignments were easy because of utilization of pre-implemented code. I just filled blank space with some codes. That's why I have to do study ML again for myself. Four weeks was too short to take the regular course of one semester, which I expected. However, the good thing was that I knew the subjects that ML deals with.

After completing all assignment, I got a gift voucher(2000 won). Thanks, I used it buy this [book](http://www.kyobobook.co.kr/product/detailViewKor.laf?ejkGb=KOR&mallGb=KOR&barcode=9788960868434&orderClick=LEA&Kc=).
