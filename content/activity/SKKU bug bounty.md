[SKKU bug bounty](http://bugbounty.skku.edu/)(2015. 5.4. – 5.15.) was the first bug bounty held among universities in Korea. Though there was a limitation about target sites, it was not bad considering the fact that it was the first try.

I found one that steals name, site ID, department, student ID, cellphone #, address, and email of members of Sungkyunkwan univ. including professors, and staffs as well as students regardless of graduation. I wish they break the limitation, not just some sites, i.e. web hacking, but other systems like printers and APs in the university.

Anyhow, thank for giving me an encouragement award.
